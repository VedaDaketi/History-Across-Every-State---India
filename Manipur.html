                <h3> Democracy v/s Constitutional Monarchy </h3>
                    <p>
                        In 1947, Manipur was a princely state ruled by Maharaja Bodhachandra Singh. The demand for responsible government in Manipur had existed pre- Independence. In November 1938, hundreds of citizens signed and submitted a petition to the Maharaja requesting a legislative council. A year later, the Nikhil Manipuri Mahasabha, which had earlier been patronized by the Maharaja as a cultural organization for Hindus, reoriented as a political party and submitted a petition to the Maharaja for a unicameral legislature. In 1946, parties like the Kuki National Assembly and the Praja Sangha were founded to pursue democracy over monarchy. Towards the end of 1946, the Nikhil Manipuri Mahasabha, the left-oriented Manipur Krishak Sabha, and the Youth Front founded the Manipur State Congress with the objective of securing responsible government in Manipur. The Manipur State Congress did not include the Praja Sangha. <br>
                        Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru wrote to Maharaja Bodhachandra Singh that ‘the future of Manipur state obviously lies with the Union of India’
                         
                        and wished for it to develop while retaining its distinct cultural entity. The Governor of Assam, Sir Muhammad Saleh Akbar Hydari, visited Manipur to explore the merger of the state with India and to campaign for the establishment of responsible government. The Maharaja signed the Standstill Agreement and the Instrument of Accession with the Dominion of India just days before Indian Independence. This transferred control of Manipur’s external affairs, defence and communication, but not internal administration. So, in order to create a constitutional monarchy, the Maharaja put together a Constitution Drafting Committee. The Manipur State Constitution Act, 1947, put the Maharaja at the constitutional head of the state. He appointed his younger brother, Priyobarta Singh, as the chief minister and headed an assembly and a council of ministers. Elections were held to the Manipur State Assembly in 1948.
                        The Manipur State Congress, meanwhile, campaigned for responsible government by launching a satyagraha movement (non-violent civil resistance). The Praja Sangha led a joint meeting of the representatives of nine political parties from across Manipur where they not only demanded full responsible government but also formed a United Manipur Front to keep the territorial integrity of Manipur.<br> 
                        The political affiliations in Manipur were split down the middle. On one side, the Maharaja and his ruling party favoured an autonomous and sovereign Manipur led by a constitutional monarchy that maintained continuing relations with India. On the other side, the Manipur State Congress and other political parties demanded the integration and merger of Manipur with India. One proposal suggested merging Manipur as a district in Assam, another suggested forming a separate Purbachal state that included—in various iterations—nearly every region around the Assam plains, and a third suggested creating an autonomous state of Manipur within the Union of India. There was even talk of attempting to integrate Manipur with the neighbouring country of Burma.
                        The matter of fully integrating Manipur with India still remained. For this, the Maharaja had to transfer the administration of Manipur to India. In September 1949, the Assam Governor, Sir Akbar Hydari, invited Maharaja
                         
                        Bodhachandra Singh to Shillong and pressed upon him to sign the Manipur Merger Agreement. Although the Maharaja refused at first, he eventually signed after some persuasion. The agreement allowed him to keep his title and some ceremonial duties and earn a privy purse.<br> 
                        On 15 October 1949, Manipur became a chief commissioner’s province in the Union of India, through whom the Union government would directly administer the region. This also terminated the Manipur State Constitution Act and the previous legislative assembly and ministry in Manipur. The existing dewan, Major General Rawal Amar Singh, who had been appointed by the Union government to oversee the administration, was appointed as the chief commissioner.
                        On 26 January 1950, when India adopted its Constitution, Manipur was classified a Part C state, still kept under direct central administration. In September 1951, Parliament passed the Government of Part C States Act which provided for the constitution of a council of advisers to assist the chief commissioner in Manipur. A lieutenant-governor later replaced the chief commissioner.

                <h3> Union Territory </h3>
                <p>
                    In December 1953, the Union government set up the States Reorganisation Commission (SRC). Two years later, in its report, the SRC recommended that Manipur should continue to be centrally administered and not merged with Assam or a proposed Purbachal or hill state. The reasons included its importance as a border state, its economic development needs met by the Centre, and its racial and linguistic composition. Meitheis or Manipuris constituted two-thirds of the population, leading to a ‘consciousness of a distinct linguistic and cultural individuality’. However, the SRC also noted that Manipur could not maintain its separate existence for long and the ultimate solution was to eventually merge it with Assam. When the States Reorganisation Act was passed in 1956, all Part C states, including
 
                    Manipur, were redesignated as union territories, which continued to be centrally administered.
                    This was quickly followed by the Territorial Councils Act, 1956.
                    Applicable to the union territories of Manipur, Tripura and Himachal Pradesh, this Act established territorial councils as a way to grant some autonomy in local affairs. This included education, public health, roads, animal husbandry and even levying taxes, subject to central approval. 
                    However, demands for greater autonomy kept growing in Manipur. In 1961, the Centre constituted a committee headed by the Union Law Minister, Ashoke Kumar Sen, which recommended ‘the largest possible measure of autonomy’ . It suggested the introduction of panchayati raj as well as the transfer of more subjects to the territorial councils. However, what the union territories really wanted were legislative bodies.<br>
                    In 1962, after Goa, Daman & Diu and Pondicherry were integrated into India as union territories, and the State of Nagaland Act was passed, the Union government decided to go above and beyond the recommendations of the Ashoke Sen Committee. It passed the Government of Union Territories Act, 1963, which was reminiscent of the pre-SRC Government of the Part C States Act, 1951. It established legislative assemblies and councils of ministers and abolished territorial councils in five union territories—Manipur, Tripura, Himachal Pradesh, Goa and Pondicherry. 
                    The Act also created two classes of union territories. These five union territories comprised the more advanced first class and were seen as being independent stand-alone entities. Their legislative assemblies had powers and responsibilities similar to the state legislative assemblies, including the ability to make laws on subjects in the Union and Concurrent lists. They even had separate consolidated and contingency funds. Manipur got its first chief minister in Mairembam Koireng Singh of the Indian National Congress (INC). Rather than ultimately having to merge with Assam, statehood itself was now a possible future for Manipur.<br>
                    In 1967, the state legislature passed the Manipur Hill Areas (Acquisition of Chiefs’ Rights) Act, which authorized the government to acquire the rights of the chiefs over the land and compensate them in return. However,
                     
                    following protests by the chiefs, the Act was not implemented and chieftainship continued. Around the same time, public debates began in Manipur, especially among the youth, about the circumstances under which the Manipur Merger Agreement was signed in 1949. This escalated into protests, eventually resulting in the imposition of President’s rule in Manipur in October 1969.

                    Statehood
                </h3>
                <p>
                    On 30 December 1971, Parliament passed the North-Eastern Areas (Reorganisation) Act, which brought into existence three new states— Meghalaya, Manipur and Tripura—and two new union territories— Mizoram and Arunachal Pradesh. On 21 January 1972, the full-fledged state of Manipur was born. In March, President’s rule was revoked and Mohammed Alimuddin of the Manipur People’s Party became the first chief minister of the new state of Manipur.
